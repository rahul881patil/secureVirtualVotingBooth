# secureVirtualVotingBooth

Course project to implement secure virtual voting booth system using RSA key algorithm

1. Developed Secure Voting Booth System with the help of RSA key encryption algorithm in Java.
2. Created public, private keys for various users to communicate securely with server.
3. Digital signature is used to achieve the authenticity using private key of a perticular client.
4. Used multithreading concept to process multiple client sequest at server side.
